# Manual Verification Steps

1. Start the bot and begin a candidate profile exchange as usual.
2. When prompted about relocation, answer **YES**.
3. Confirm that the bot's reply thanking for the profile appears directly beneath the YES message, not the original profile post.

These steps ensure `_process_profile` uses the user's confirmation message for feedback.
